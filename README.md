* **test1:** 

    A string S consisting only of the letters "A", "B" and "C" is given.
    This string can be transformed according to one of the following
    rules:
    1. substitute one occurrence of "AB" with "AA",
    2. substitute one occurrence of "BA" with "AA",
    3. substitute one occurrence of "CB" with "CC",
    4. substitute one occurrence of "BC" with "CC",
    5. substitute one occurrence of "AA" with "A",
    6. substitute one occurrence of "CC" with "C".


* **test2:** 

    function returns 1 if incoming string is an anagram of some palindrome and returns 0
    otherwise

* **test3**

    A non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is
given. The array consists only of integers in the range [0..Nâˆ’1].
Each element of the array can be treated as a pointer to another
element of the array: if A[K] = M then element A[K] points to A[M]. Return length of cycle.

* **test4**

    return perimeter of triangle
